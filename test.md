### **Scope in Python**
Scope in Python refers to the **region of code** where a variable or name is **accessible**. It determines where a variable can be **read or modified** and where it **ceases to exist**.

## **Types of Scope in Python**
Python follows the **LEGB rule**, which stands for:
1. **Local Scope** - Inside a function.
2. **Enclosing Scope** - Nested function scope.
3. **Global Scope** - Defined at the top level of a script or module.
4. **Built-in Scope** - Predefined names in Python.
